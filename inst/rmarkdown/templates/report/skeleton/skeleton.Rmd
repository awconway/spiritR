The outcome of this award will be released in June 2019. Regardless of the outcome of this application, this study will be able to be fully supported by funds received by the PI, Aaron Conway, for his appointment as Chair of Cardiovascular Nursing Research at PMCC. This includes all work undertaken by the Research Coordinator and purchasing of equipment and consumables for the HFNO and TcCO~2~ monitoring devices."
