#Assign values for each of the objects in the code chunks below. Assigning values for these elements will achieve two purposes:
# 1. To populate a table at the begining of this protocol document displaying the World Health Organization Regitration Data Set; and
# 2. To populate an xml document that can be uploaded directly to the clinicaltrials.gov registry using the create_ctxml() function.

#This template will only work for interventional trials. There are options to register Observational and Epidemiological studies on clinicaltrials.gov but this template will not meet the requirements for the xml upload for these other types of studies.
